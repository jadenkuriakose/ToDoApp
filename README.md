# ToDoApp
Created a To Do List Application using Springboot & Thymeleaf alongside Java. 

Allows you to input activities you need to do and remove items based off priority within the Springboot Application.

Made changes to the dependencies within pom.xml, ToDoController, and the thymeleaf html file. Can be executed within your own Springboot file configured with Maven dependencies.
